## Protocol

- Turn on the flow in the LAF bench 20 min before use.
- Clean the laf bench with 80% EtOH, followed by RNase AWAY™ Surface Decontaminant.
- Place a iceblock, primers, Ultramix, NF-water(open the lid) and the plasticware (2x skirted PCR-plates with associated strip-caps, 1x Dispendix pureplate 90 nm, 1x foil, and 1x Eppendorf tube) in the laf bench and UV it for 15 minutes.
- Prepare the 2 µM primer mix by adding 2 µL of each primer (Fw and Rv) to 96 µL NFW and mix by pipetting.
- Prepare the Dispendix pure plate for the I-DOT:
  - Add the calculated amount of reagents to the predetermined jets (NFW, 2x Ultramix and 2µM primer mix). Ex:
    - 2 jets with 80 µL NFW
    - 6 jets with 68,25 µL 2x Ultramix
    - 3 jets with 54,6 µL Primer mix
